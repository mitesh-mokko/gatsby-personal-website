# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mitesh Shah and I love to build stuff. I am a startup CTO, full stack software engineer, father, husband and music composer. I also dabble - in coffee, wine, writing, food plating + photography and legos. If you have an idea for a world changing startup, I would love to help make it come true.
